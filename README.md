jwatson
=======

A Java wrapper for the IBM Watson DQA service.

Getting started
---------------

The latest release is [jwatson 1.0](https://github.com/tudarmstadt-lt/jwatson/releases/tag/1.0.0).

Build
---------------

Use `sbt clean compile assembly` to build the project. The fat `jar` file can be found in the `/target` folder.

Usage - In a Nutshell
-----
```java
public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
   // Create a Watson instance with your URL and credentials
   JWatson watson = new JWatson("username", "password", "https://url/instance/xxxxx/deepqa/");

   // Query Watson to retrieve answers for a specific question
   // WatsonAnswer answer = watson.askQuestion("Who is Angela Merkel?");

   // ... or use the QuestionBuilder to construct complex questions for Watson
   WatsonQuestion question = new WatsonQuestion.QuestionBuilder("Who is Angela Merkel?")
        .setNumberOfAnswers(3) // Provide three possible answers
        .formatAnswer()        // Instruct Watson to deliver answers in HTML
        .create();

   WatsonAnswer answer = watson.askQuestion(question);
   System.out.println(answer);
}        
```

#### Note

* Make sure that the URL contains a trailing slash at the end.


Known bugs and issues
----------------
* Ping and Feedback endpoints are not implemented yet.
* To use JWatson with the Bluemix QA service instead of an university (private-) instance, you need make slightly modifications in the JSON structure.
